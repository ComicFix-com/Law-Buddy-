# Law Buddy - Open Source Legal Chatbot

**Project Name**: Law Buddy  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**License**: MIT License

## Project Overview

**Law Buddy** is an open-source project aimed at building a chatbot that provides legal recommendations and information based on user queries. Developed as part of the **Comicfix** initiative, the chatbot assists users by suggesting relevant legal sections, offering brief legal advice, and supplying other related legal information.

The goal of Law Buddy is to make legal assistance more accessible through instant, AI-driven responses to general law-related questions. By contributing to this project, you will be helping enhance a tool that can potentially support individuals in understanding legal concepts and navigating legal issues more easily.

## How It Works

- Users submit a legal query through the chatbot.
- The bot analyzes the query using natural language processing (NLP).
- Relevant legal sections, advice, or guidelines are returned to the user.
- The system can be updated to support different jurisdictions and legal systems.
